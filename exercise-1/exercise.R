# Exercise 1: Lists


# Create a vector of everything you ate for breakfast
breakfast <- c("Bagel", "Peanut butter", "Milk");

# Create a vector of everything you ate for lunch
lunch <- c("Cheeseburger", "French fries");

# Create a list `meals` that has contains your breakfast and lunch
meals <- list(breakfast=breakfast, lunch=lunch);

# Add a `dinner` index to your `meals` list that has what you plan to eat for dinner
meals$dinner <- c("Chicken", "Rice");

# Extract your 'dinner' element from your list and save it in a vector called 'dinner'
dinner <- meals[['dinner']];

### Bonus ### 
# Create a list that has the number of items you ate for each meal
items <- lapply(meals, length);

# Write a function that adds pizza to every meal
AddPizza <- function(input) {
  input <- c(input, "pizza");
}

# Add pizza to every meal!
lots.of.pizza <- lapply(meals, AddPizza);
